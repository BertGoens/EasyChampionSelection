**Downloads are in the description below, not the Download ZIP button! That is if you want the source code.**

A small programn to help relieve your in champion select.  
Ever had it occuring to you that in the heat of the moment you forgot your champion pool?  
ECS will pop up a window for you so you'll never have to remember them again.
It's smart enough to only show up when it's your turn to pick or ban.

##First: 
Add some groups and put some champions in them.

Once you've done that you can hide your main window so it doesn't take up space.  
A tray icon will still do what you want.

Alright, now we have our gruops the only thing resting us is getting into champion select.  
Notice the little window next to the Skins-tab.

##Lastly:
Click on the dropdown-menu and all your groups will appear.  
Want to see 1 or multiple groups? Simply tick the checkbox.
Don't click away at this moment as my program functions as a typewriter.
